## Known issues (read before using!)

* The initial Bluetooth pairing probably doesn't work (I haven't tested it). I recommend first pairing with other apps such as Gadgetbridge, then adding the device on PinePartner.
* It crashes a lot.
* Some parts of the UI are still very barebones.
* There's a lot of functionality missing but feel free to make feature requests if you feel like anything important has been left out.
* The app has only been tested on a PineTime running the latest InfiniTime version.
* The app is missing an icon, so please shoot any ideas my way.

I recommend not running multiple companion apps at the same time since they will probably interfere with each other.
